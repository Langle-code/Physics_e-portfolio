## 1. INTRODUCTION / BIO

Hello! I am Edwyn Angel Barja Maglasang, a BS Computer Science student taking this college physics 2 course to deepen my understanding of how the world works from the ground up.

My initial goals for the course were:

- Learn more about physics in general  
- Gain a deeper understanding of core theories  
- See how concepts apply in real-world settings  
- Understand physics applications across various fields and industries  

I aimed to see physics not only as equations—but as patterns, logic, and hidden machinery running underneath reality.

Course Outcomes: 
Course Outcome 1: Students will learn about the principles of electricity, electric charge, electric fields, and electric potential. Students will also learn about Coulomb's law and the concept of electric field lines. The module aims to build a strong foundation for understanding more complex concepts in electricity. Furthermore, students will explore the fundamental principles of electric circuits and Ohm's law. They will learn about resistance, current, and voltage, and how these elements relate to each other in a circuit. The module will cover Kirchhoff's laws and the calculation of equivalent resistance in series and parallel circuits.

Course Outcome 2: Explore the basic concepts of magnetism, including magnetic fields, magnetic forces, and magnetic materials. Understand how magnetic fields are created and how they interact with each other.

Course Outcome 3: This module introduces the fundamental concepts of geometric optics. Students will explore the basic principles of reflection and refraction and how these principles apply to everyday optical devices. Expect hands-on activities to apply these concepts in practical situations, enhancing understanding through visualization.

## REFLECTIVE ESSAY

Throughout this course, I discovered several things about myself as a learner.

One of my strengths is curiosity—I naturally want to know *why* things work the way they do, which helped me understand physics not only as formulas but as a system of interconnected ideas that describe real-life motion, energy, and forces.

But I also faced challenges. When concepts turned abstract or required multiple steps, I sometimes struggled. I realized I rush toward the final answer instead of breaking down the reasoning carefully. This course taught me to slow down, identify the principle behind each problem, and to revisit foundational concepts when needed.

I also strengthened my analytical mindset—dissecting problems, recognizing patterns, and understanding the logic behind physical systems. As a future computer scientist, these skills translate directly into areas like graphics, simulations, robotics, hardware understanding, and algorithm design.

In the end, this course didn’t just help me learn physics—it helped me refine how I think.
